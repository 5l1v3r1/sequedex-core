This is Sequedex version 2.1.1, build 20181211.  The release for this build is
v2.r20181211 and the Los Alamos National Laboratory Codes ID is C18101.

Quick start instructions for installing and running Sequedex are 
available as a pdf file (SequedexQuickStart.pdf) or Word document
(SequedexQuickStart.docx) in the doc directory.

For more information on Sequedex, visit http://sequedex.lanl.gov.
Online documentation can be found at  https://sequedex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
It should be noted that both the sequedex website and the online documentation were 
written for Sequedex Version 1 and thus are currently out of date.  However, updates
for Version 2 are under development;  and, in any case, a lot of the website and 
documentation is still relevant.

Data modules distributed either with the software or from 
sequedex.lanl.gov are covered by Los Alamos National Laboratory 
LA-UR-18-31119.

If you have checked out the source code from the git repository,
instructions for building Sequedex can be found in README_BUILD.txt.
