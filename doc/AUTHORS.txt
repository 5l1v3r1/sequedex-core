Joel Berendzen helped define the applications, was the architect for
the algorithms, wrote the packaging and launcher scripts, and led the coding team.

Judith Cohn implemented the algorithms, wrote the majority of the
Java source code, and did much of the data wrangling needed to develop the data 
modules and algorithms.

Mira Dimitrijevic wrote the Java code that implements the command-line,
configuration file, licensing, and miscellaneous other features.  She also was
the primary developer for the Sequinator HTML5 application for displaying
output.

Ben McMahon did the phylogenetic calculations on which the algorithms
rely, wrote the documentation, did the lion's share of functional testing, and 
pioneered the applications.

Nick Hengartner managed the overall project and contributed
statistical analysis, including overseeing development of an R-based tool 
for viewing Sequescan output.
